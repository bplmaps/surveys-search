# Property Surveys and Plans at LMEC

Search property surveys and plans in the [Leventhal Centerâ€™s collections](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/). Search by streets, owners, and cities to filter results, and use the map to see the approximate locations. Click on a map pin for survey information and to make an appointment to view the survey in our reading room. 

Only a portion of our property surveys and plans have been inventoried. This tool currently searches:
* All items in the [Robert Bayard Bellamy Surveying Papers](https://archives.bpl.org/repositories/2/resources/158)
* Some items in the [Dana F. Perkins, Inc. Surveying Records](https://archives.bpl.org/repositories/2/resources/159)
* Some auction and lot plans 

See [this page](https://guides.bpl.org/urban-planning/bpl#s-lg-box-wrapper-28584680) for information about collections that have not yet been inventoried. Contact <reference@leventhalmap.org> for assistance.
